            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>What conſcience is:</hi> It may be thus deſcribed. Conſcience <hi>is a power and faculty of the ſoule taking knowledge, and bearing witneſſe of all a mans thoughts, words &amp; actions, &amp; accordingly excuſing or accuſing, abſoluing or condemning, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forting or tormenting the ſame.</hi> I know there be other definitions giuen by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more ſuccinct, and neat, but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe this, though it may bee not altogether ſo formall to the rules of Art. The rules of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oue and profit many times may make bold to diſpence with rules of Art. So I may be profitable, I care the leſſe to bee artificiall. It may ſuffice that this deſcription is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that Auditory for whoſe ſake it was firſt intended. A plaine familiar
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180769:18"/> deſcription agrees well enough with ſuch a people. For the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it let it be taken in pieces, and euery parcell viewed ſeuerally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a faculty, or power of the ſoule.</hi> It is therefore called the <hi>Heart, 1. Iohn. 3. 20. If our heart condemne vs. Eccl. 7. 22. Thine owne heart knowes that thou thy ſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haſt curſed others,</hi> that is thine own conſcience knowes. It is alſo called the <hi>ſpirit of man, 1. Cor. 2. 11. For what man knowes the things of a man, ſaue the</hi> ſpirit of man <hi>which is in him.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelfe beares witneſſe with our ſpirit,</hi> that is, with our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. Not that conſcience is a ſpirit diſtinct from the ſubſtance of the ſoule, as <hi>Origen</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtooke, but becauſe it is a faculty of the ſoule, therefore the name that is oft gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ſoule, is giuen to it. If it bee asked in what part of the ſoule this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is placed, wee muſt know that Conſcience is not confined to any one part of the ſoule: It is not in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alone, not in the memory, will, or affections alone, but it hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180769:18"/> place in all the parts of the ſoule, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeuerall parts thereof hath ſeuerall Offices, or Acts.</p>

                  <hi>Taking knowledge: Eccle.</hi> 7. 22. Thine owne heart <hi>knowes.</hi> Conſcience is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſoule as Gods ſpy, &amp; mans ſuperiour and ouerſeer, an inſeperable companion that is with a man at all times, and in all places; ſo that there is not a thought, word, or worke that it knowes not, and takes not notice of. So that that which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes of God himſelfe, <hi>Pſal. 139. 3. 4. Thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeſt my heart, &amp; my lying downe, and art acquainted with all my wayes, for there is not a word in my tongue but loe thou knoweſt it altogether. Whither ſhall I goe from thy ſpirit!

Their conſcience bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180769:20"/> mans deeds. And this teſtimony of conſcience is without all exception, for in the mouth of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes euery word ſhall ſtand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (as our common ſaying is) is a thouſand witneſſes: for it is an ey-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our actions, yea a pen-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bringing teſtimony from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Records &amp; Regiſters of the Court of Conſcience. Concerning this teſtifying office of conſcience that place is worth the noting, <hi>Iſa. 59. 12. For our tranſgreſsions are multiplyed before thee, and our ſinnes teſtifie againſt vs, for our tranſgreſsions are with vs, and as for our iniquities we know them.</hi> By which place wee may know the meaning of the word Conſcience. Conſcience is a <hi>knowledge together.</hi> How together? Firſt, a knowledge together with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, namely with God, when God and a mans heart know a thing, there is Conſcience, knowledge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. My Conſcience (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Co-witneſſing, witneſſing toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. How together? God knowes it &amp;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180769:20"/> witneſſes, &amp; my conſcience together with him knows, &amp; witneſſes. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, a knowledge ioyned together with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother knowledge; for there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act of the vnderſtanding. Firſt, that whereby wee thinke or know a thing. Secondly, there is a reflecting act of the ſoule whereby wee thinke what we thinke, and know what we know, and this is the action of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this ioyning of this ſecond knowledge to the firſt, giues it the name of Conſcience. As here in this place, As for our iniquities we know them, that is, wee know that wee haue had euill thoughts, &amp; our knowledge tels vs, and witneſſes to vs that we haue done ſo. This agrees with <hi>Bernards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, that <hi>Conſcientia eſt cordis ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> Conſcience is the knowledge of the heart, namely paſſiuely. It is the knowing of what the heart knowes: which others in better tearmes haue expreſſed thus, Conſcience is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling of the ſoule vpon it ſelfe. Suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 4. I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180769:21"/> know nothing but my ſelfe.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I know not any thing that I know againſt my ſelfe, my Conſcience doth not witneſſe againſt me. And this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond office of Conſcience in bearing witneſſe is alſo in the memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And accordingly accuſing or excuſing, abſoluing or condemning</hi>] Theſe acts of Conſcience we finde. <hi>Rom. 2. 15. Their thoughts accuſing or excuſing one another. Rom.</hi> 14. 22. Happy is he that <hi>condemneth</hi> not himſelfe in that which he allowes. The ground of theſe Acts is this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, before actions are to be done, determines of their lawfulnes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe; iudges of them whether they be good or euill. And if it iudge them good, it inuites, ſtirres vp, vrges, &amp; bindes to the doing of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. Yee muſt be ſubiect <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> that is, becauſe conſcience deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it to be good, &amp; vrges, and binds thereunto. Hence that phraſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech, my conſcience vrgeth me to it, or he was vrged in conſcience to do it, and I am bound in conſcience to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180769:21"/> doe it. Certainely if it iudge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine actions to be euill and vnlawfull, then it binds from them. So much that ſpeech implyes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. Eate, asking no queſtion <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> So that Conſcience hath a power to binde to, and to binde from.</p>
               <p>Now then when a man in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions doth follow the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Dictates, Iniunctions, Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; Determinations of conſcience, and hearkens to the incitements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience <hi>excuſes</hi> him, acquits and <hi>abſolues</hi> him. But if in his actions he goe againſt any of theſe, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>accuſes</hi> him of offence, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes</hi> him for that offence. The <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> of conſcience hath reſpect vnto a mans <hi>guilt,</hi> the <hi>condemnation</hi> of it vnto a mans <hi>puniſhment. Accuſation</hi> is an act of Conſcience paſſing ſentence vpon a mans action, as when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels him. This was ill done, this action was ſinfull. <hi>Condemnation</hi> is an act of conſcience, paſſing ſentence not only vpon a mans action, but vpon a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180769:22"/> mans perſon, as when it tels him, Thou deſerueſt Gods wrath for this ſin. Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience in accuſing ſhewes what is the <hi>quality;</hi> in condemning what is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert</hi> of a mans action. And theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Conſcience are in the mind, and vnderſtanding part of the ſoule. The act of Conſcience in the memory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines <hi>de facto,</hi> and tels vs what wee haue done, or not done. The act of Conſcience in the vnderſtanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines <hi>de iure,</hi> and tells vs whether we haue done well or ill, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly either excuſes or accuſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits or condemnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Comforting or tormenting the ſame</hi>] theſe be the laſt acts of conſcience fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the former. If Conſcience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining, preſcribing, and inciting to good, be hearkened vnto, then it excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, acquits, and thereupon followes comfort, ioy, hope, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. This is <hi>our reioycing,</hi> the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Contrarily if the dictates of conſcience be not regarded, it accuſes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnes, &amp; then torments with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180769:22"/> feare, griefe, deſpaire, and violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, in all which is that <hi>Worme. Mar.</hi> 9. 44. And theſe actions of the Conſcience are in the will, and in the affections. And thus according to the diuers parts of the ſoule, the acts and office of Conſcience are diuers.

                  <hi>Vprightneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> theſe two are required to the conſtitution of a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is good with the goodnes of <hi>Integrity,</hi> when it is an vpright conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> cals <hi>A pure Conſcience, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 3. which phraſe a man would almoſt thinke in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the holy Ghoſt vſed on ſet purpoſe, to ſtop the mouth of the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the later times, that ſhould ſeeke to diſgrace all good Conſcience with the ſarcaſme of puritie. Now the Conſcience is good with this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Integritie, and puritie three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it being informed &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principled by the word of God, the only rule and binder of Conſcience, it doth truly &amp; ſincerely Iudge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine euill to be euill, and good to be good. As contrarily, the conſcience is ſinfully euill, when it doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that to be euill which is euill, nor that to be good which is good, but cals euill good, and good euill. Such as are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180769:24"/> the Conſciences of Ignorant perſons, who wanting the knowledge of Gods word, and hauing their conſciences blinded through ignorance, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to iudge of good and euill, nor to diſcerne &amp; determine which is which. So that knowledge is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the goodneſſe of Conſcience. <hi>Rom. 15. 14. Ye alſo are full of goodneſſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all knowledge.</hi> The conſcience cannot be good where the ſoule is naught, and <hi>that the ſoule bee without knowledge, it is not good</hi> Prov. 19. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it doth excuſe for that which is good, and accuſe for that which is euill, being ſanctified by the ſpirit of grace: for the accuſation of conſcience though it follow vpon ſin, yet it is not ſinfull, and euill in it ſelfe, but onely painefull and troubleſome, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the goodneſſe of peace, not to the goodnes of vprightnes, according to that trite diſtinction of <hi>Bernard</hi> of a good conſcience, and not quiet, and a quiet conſcience and not good. It is the propertie of a Conſcience vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180769:25"/> good, to accuſe vpon any ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. As contrarily, the conſcience is ſinfully euill, when it doth not excuſe for good, nor accuſe for euill. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perſtitious perſon, omitting his foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould be excuſed by his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereas he rather receiues blame from his conſcience, therefore his conſcience is ſinfully euill. The ſecure perſons conſcience is naught, becauſe he hauing committed ſinne, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſilent, &amp; lets him alone, and brings in no accuſation againſt him, therefore it is ſinfully euill. It is <hi>a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> that hath <hi>ſeene,</hi> and <hi>knowne</hi> euill, and doth <hi>not vtter it,</hi> therefore it <hi>ſhall beare its iniquitie.</hi> Levit. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it doth incite and vrge vs to doe good, and doth ſtay and hinder from euill. It is vprightly good when it ſpurs to good, &amp; bridles from euill. <hi>Heb. 13. 18. For wee are aſſured that wee haue a good Conſcience.</hi> viz. A Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is neither ſilent to perſwade to that which is good, or diſwade from that which is euill. If a man goe about,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180769:25"/> or bee ready to yeeld to any thing that is ſinfull, how will it muſter vp legions of Arguments, how will it wreſtle and ſtruggle with a man? It will ſay as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> to <hi>Ioab. 2 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 26. Knoweſt thou not that it will be bitternes in the latter end?</hi> or as <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 31. <hi>It ſhall be no griefe, nor offence of heart vnto thee</hi> another time, not to haue done this euill. If a man be neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and drowſie in good duties, it comes to him with that voyce, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 14. Awake thou that ſleepest;</hi> or with that <hi>Iſa. 30. 21. This is the way walke in it.</hi> When it doth thus, it is vprightly good. Contrarily, it is ſinfully euill when it doth not incite vs to that which is good, nor hinder vs from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill. This is a dead, and a ſeared conſcience. 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. Hauing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſeared with an hot yron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is good with the goodneſſe of <hi>Tranquility.</hi> And that is when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is at Peace, and doth not accuſe vs, becauſe it hath not wherewith to accuſe vs, either becauſe not guilty of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180769:26"/> ſuch or ſuch a particular fact. 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 4 I know nothing by my ſelfe;</hi> or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is aſſured of pardon, in the blood of Chriſt, by which we come to haue no <hi>more Conſcience of ſins.</hi> Heb. 10. 2 That is, no more Conſcience to accuſe or condemne for ſinne, it being done away in the bloud of Chriſt. And this is the <hi>purged Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. which brings Hope, Ioy, Comfort, and Confidence with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. This is our reioycing, the teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Then is the Conſcience good when it is peaceable. As contrarily, then is it euill, painefully euill, when it is turbulent, and troubleſome in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations thereof, and binds ouer to Iudgement, and ſo leaues vs in ſhame, feare, perplexity, and griefe. 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 20. If our heart co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne vs.</hi> This is a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a troubled conſcience. This is oft the euill Conſcience of euill men: <hi>Iſa. 57. 21. There is no peace to the wicked, faith my God.</hi> Yet may a man haue his conſcience vprightly good, which is painefully euill, for a good mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180769:26"/> may bee vnquiet and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Thus then wee ſee what a good conſcience is, that which is vprightly honeſt, and quietly peaceable. This being ſo, it ſerues to diſcouer the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour of diuers ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are in a dreame of hauing good conſciences, and yet hauing no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing leſſe. There be three ſorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which becauſe they are in ſome ſort quiet, and ſting not, their owners would haue to goe for good ones, and yet are ſtarke naught, and they are, The <hi>Ignorant;</hi> The <hi>Secure,</hi> and the <hi>Seared</hi> Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ignorant</hi> conſcience. Men iudge of their ignorant conſciences, as they doe of their blind, dumbe, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Miniſters. Such neither do nor can Preach, can neither tel men of their ſinnes, nor of their duties. Aske ſuch a blind guides people, what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is of him, and what a kinde of man their Miniſter is, and yee ſhall haue him magnified for a paſſing honeſt harmeleſſe man, and a man wondrous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180769:27"/> quiet amongſt his neighbours. They may doe what they will for him, he is none of thoſe troubleſome fellowes that will be reprouing their faults, or complaining of their diſorders in the Pulpit; oh, ſuch a one is a quiet good man indeed. Thus iudge many of their Conſciences. If their conſciences bee quiet, and lie not grating vpon them, and telling them that their courſes are ſinfull and damnable, and that their perſons are in a dangerous condition, but rather by their ſilence, ignorance, and vaine pretences doe iuſtifie them, and tell them all will be well enough. Oh then what excellent good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences haue theſe men. They make no conſcience of Familie duties, once in the yeere to come to the Sacrament ſerues the turne; they are common ſwearers in their ordinary communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; make no conſcience of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sabbaths, &amp;c. and their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lets them alone in all theſe, doe not giue them one ſyllable of ill language, oh what gentle, and good natured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180769:27"/> thinke theſe men they haue? But alas what <hi>euill</hi> conſciences haue they. A good conſcience muſt be <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> as well as <hi>peaceable.</hi> And an vp right conſcience is enlightned with the knowledge of the Word, and by that light iudges what is good, and what is euill, and when it finds mens actions not to be good, &amp; warrantable deales plainely, and lets them heare of it. A good conſcience hath good eyes, and is able to diſcerne betweene good and euill. Now theſe mens conſciences are quiet, &amp; haue their mouthes ſhut, but whence is it? Becauſe their eyes are ſhut, and they are dumbe, becauſe they are blind. Right Idoll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they want mouthes to ſpeake, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uſe they want eyes to ſee. So that it may be ſaid of ſuch conſciences as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes of thoſe Watchmen. <hi>Iſa. 56. 10. His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumbe dogs, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bark.</hi> Their blindnes bred dumb<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and their ignorance ſilence. Thus is it with ignorant Conſciences. What
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180769:28"/> is the reaſon they barke not, but are dumbe, and are thus quiet? Meerely becauſe they are blind and ignorant.</p>
               <p>But yet as good as men account theſe conſciences now, the time will come that it ſhall fare with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it did with <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eue</hi> after they had eaten the forbidden fruit, <hi>Then their eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</hi> So the time ſhall come when theſe Conſciences ſhall haue their eies opened, &amp; then alſo ſhal their mouths by oyened, yea wide, &amp; lowd opened, and theſe now quiet conſciences ſhall both barke and bite too. Do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flatter thy ſelfe in thine Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as if thy condition, &amp; conſcience were good, becauſe quiet.

                  </gap> true Peace which is not ioyned with vprightnes. Integrity, &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can no more ſtand together, then light and darkeneſſe. Integrity of conſcience may be without Peace, Peace can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be without Integritie. Dumbe Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſters goe in the world for good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, becauſe quiet ones, but the day will come that men ſhall curſe them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180769:28"/> for hauing beene ſo quiet. So Ignorant and tongue tyed conſciences goe for good ones, but the time will come that men will curſe this peace of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for bringing them ſo quietly to hell. The Maſſe goes for an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good ſeruice, becauſe <hi>Miſſa non mordet,</hi> honeſt toothles deuotion, it neuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens fang in the hearers fleſh. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue Maſſe-like conſciences, tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and tongueleſſe conſciences, but yet the time will come, that as Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers ſhall curſe their toothleſſe Maſſe, ſo ignorant perſons that now glory in their peace, ſhall curſe their toothleſſe conſcience, yea they ſhall gnaſh their teeth, becauſe conſcience had no teeth, &amp; ſhal gnaw their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues for anguiſh of heart, becauſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences wanted tongues to tell them of the danger of their wicked wayes, that haue brought them to ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecure</hi> conſcience. As the blind conſcience was like the dumbe Miniſter, ſo the ſecure conſcience is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180769:29"/> like the flattering Miniſter, that (<hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 13.) heales the hurt of his people with <hi>ſweete words, &amp; cryes, peace, peace, where there is no peace.</hi> This conſcience wants not an eye, but only a good tongue in the head. It ſees its maſter to doe euill, and knowes it to bee euill, but either cares not to ſpeake, or elſe is eaſily put off from ſpeaking, ſometime it cares not to ſpeake, being ſleepy, heauy, and drowſie, like thoſe Prophets. <hi>Iſa. 56. 10. They are all dumbe dogs, they cannot barke.</hi> What was the reaſon? <hi>Sleeping, lying downe, louing to ſlumber.</hi> A ſleepy, and heauy-eyde Curre, though hee ſee one come into his Maſters yard, or houſe, that ſhould not, yet barkes not, as loath by his barking to diſquiet himſelfe. A ſleepy ſecure Conſcience ſees many a ſin to enter the ſoule that ſhould not, and yet lies ſtill, and ſayes nothing, is loath to breake its ſleepe. And yet ſuch Conſciences men count good.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it may bee it offers to ſpeake, as a ſleepy dog may open once,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180769:29"/> or twiſe at a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers entrance, yet is ſoone ſnibd, the leaſt word of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe makes him whiſt, and quiet. So ſecure Conſciences vpon the greene wound begin to ſmart, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the freſh commiſſion of ſinne begin to mutter, &amp; to haue ſome grudgings, but their maſter anſwers them as the friend in his bed did his neighbour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to borrow three loaues. <hi>Luc. 11. 17. Trouble me not, for I am in bed.</hi> I pray thee be quiet, let vs haue no wrangling and brawling, it ſhall be ſo no more, I will cry God mercy, I will hereafter finde a time for repentance, &amp;c. and ſo Conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce being ſecure, is eaſily put of with a few good words, &amp; ſo cloſing her eyes, and mouth againe giues her maſter liberty to take his reſt. And thus the ſecure conſcience becauſe it is ſo eaſily huſht, &amp; ſtilld, is counted a good conſcience, as Nurces count them good children which though they are ready to cry at euery turne, yet are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily quieted with ſome toy.</p>
               <p>But this conſcience is as farre from a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180769:30"/> good Conſcience, as Security is from Integritie. Sin indeede ſleepes, but yet it ſleepes but dog-ſleepe, yea though it ſleepe ſoundly, yet it cannot ſleepe long. <hi>Gen. 4. 7. Sinne lies at the doore.</hi> Sin lies a ſleepe in the conſcience as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtife lyes at the doore. A place where a dog cannot ſleepe long. The doore is the common paſſage into, &amp; out of the houſe, euery one is paſſing to and fro that way, and keepe ſuch a clattering with the opening, and ſhutting of the doore, that there can be no ſound, or at leaſt no long ſleepe. No better is the ſleepe of ſecure conſciences, which at length like mad ban-dogs, and fell Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifes, will fly in the face of the ſinner, ready to plucke out the very throat and heart of him.</p>
               <p>The ſecure Conſcience can bee no good conſcience, becauſe it hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>vprightnes,</hi> nor <hi>peace,</hi> both which were before required to the temper of a good one. <hi>Vprightnes</hi> hath it none, for it is not faithfull in its office, it doth not witneſſe, it doth not accuſe, as it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180769:30"/> becomes an honeſt vpright conſcience to doe. <hi>Peace</hi> it hath none. There is a great difference betweene a peace, and a truce. In peace there is a totall depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, both of Armes and Enmitie, all hoſtile affections are put of: In a truce, there is but a ſuſpenſion and a ceſſation of Armes for a ſeaſon, ſo as during the ſame there is ſtill prouiſion of more Forces, and a preparation of greater ſtrength. A truce is but a breathing time to fit for fiercer impreſſions. The truce being ended, the aſſaults are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiercer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were before. The ſecure conſciences are quiet, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is peace, for <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> Iſa. 57. 21.<note place="margin">Quomodo tranquilla? cum mundi huius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludit, &amp; illudit, cum laudatur peccator in deſideriis animae ſuae. Bernard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Conſc.</note> But becauſe there is ſome truce, the world ſmiles vpon them, &amp; they haue outward hearts eaſe, and this brings them aſleepe, but if any affliction, croſſe, or ſickneſſe come, then they ſee how farre they are from peace. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſometime at truce with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners, but during this truce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is preparing Armes, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180769:31"/> againſt them, is leuying of freſh Forces againſt them, and aſſoone as the truce is ended, be it ſooner or be it later, haue at them with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, fury, and fierceneſſe then euer before. And the truce once ended, it will eaſily appeare, what a wide breadth of difference, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ſecure &amp; a good conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Seared</hi> conſcience. That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. A cauterized Conſcience.</hi> That is, as <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates and expounds it. A conſcience cut off as it were with a Chirurgions Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. An arme, or a leg cut off from the body, ſtab it, gaſh it, chop it into gobbets, doe what you will with it, it is inſenſible, it feeles it not. Or elſe as our tranſlation hath it, <hi>Hauing their conſciences ſeared with an hot yron.</hi> A compariſon borrowed from Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. When a lim is cut off, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions vſe to ſeare that part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from whence the other is taken with an hot yron, and ſometimes they doe cures by ſearing the affected parts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180769:31"/> with hot yrons. Now theſe parts vpon their ſearing haue a kinde of cruſty brawnineſſe, which is vtterly inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which though it be cut, or pricked, it neither bleeds, nor feeles. Thus is it with many mens Conſciences, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit they whatſoeuer ſinnes they will, yet their hearts are ſo hardened through long cuſtome in ſin, that they ſeele no gripings, pinches, or bitings at all, but are growne to that dead, and dedolent diſpoſition. <hi>Ephe. 4. 19. who being paſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c.</hi> It is with ſuch mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as with labouring mens hands, which through much labour haue a brawny hardnes growing vpon them, which is without any feeling. One may thruſt pins into it, pare it with a knife, and yet without any trouble or griefe at all. Such callous Conſciences haue many that though they bee wounded, and gaſhed with neuer ſuch foule ſins, yet their conſciences ſhrinke not, feele not a whit. Their Conſciences are like Gally-ſlaues backes, ſo be brawned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with often laſhing, that an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180769:32"/> laſh will not make them ſo much as once ſhucke in their ſhoulders. You haue many that can ſweare, not only your more ciuill oathes, of faith and troth, but thoſe ruffianly, and bloody oathes, of blood and wounds, and it neuer wounds their hearts a whit. You haue many that can commit foule ſins with leſſe touch then others can heare of them. You ſhall haue black-Smithes that are vſed to the frequent and daily handling of hot yron, hold an hot fire-coale in their hands, and langh, whilſt another would roare out. There bee thoſe that can be drunk day after day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that conſecrate whole Sabbaths to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> can giue themſelues vp to foule villanies, and yet not one twitch at the heart, not a ſnib, not a croſſe word from their Conſciences. Eſtrich-like they can concoct yron, &amp; put it off as eaſily as another weake ſtomacke can doe gelly. They haue brought their hearts to that paſſe the drunkards body is in; <hi>Pro. 25. 35. They haue ſtricken mee and I was not ſicke, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180769:32"/> haue beaten me and I felt it not.</hi> Their ſeared Conſciences haue no more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then our ſotted Drunkards haue in their drunkenneſſe, who though they haue many a knocke, and ſore bruiſe, yet feele it not. To this fearefull condition, and ſenſleſſe and ſeared ſtupidity of Conſcience many grow, &amp; when they haue thus cruſted and brawned the ſame, then they haue their Conſciences at a good paſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they heare them not brawling within them. Alas how farre are ſuch from goodnes of Conſcience. In ſome ſenſe, thoſe haue worſe Conſciences then the Diuell himſelfe, who beleeues and trembles, whoſe Conſcience yet is not ſo ſeared, but it trembles at the thoughts of his deſerued damnation.</p>
               <p>And howſoever theſe ſeared conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are quiet, yet there will come a day that this ſeared cruſtineſſe ſhall be ſcaled off, and thoſe conſciences which were not ſenſible of ſinne, ſhal be moſt ſenſible of pain: though they were paſt feeling in the committing of ſinne, yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180769:33"/> they ſhall be all feeling in ſuffering pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne. God will pare off that brawnineſſe from their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and will pare them ſo to the quick, that they ſhall feele and moſt ſenſibly feele that which here they would not feele. Tremble therefore at the hauing of ſuch a conſcience, in which there is neither vprightneſſe, nor peace; nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther integrity, nor tranquillitie, but a ſenſleſſe &amp; feareful ſtupiditie. Thus we haue ſeene what a good conſcience is.</p>

                  <p>Peace of Conſcience how gotten.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT followes now to knowe how a man may get and keepe a good one, which is the third point which was propounded to bee handled. A point wel worth our enquiring after. A good Conſcience is the moſt precious thing that a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can haue: a thing of that eſteeme that where it is wanting, we ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count a man without a conſcience. So
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180769:33"/> of a man that hath an ill Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience we vſe to ſay, he is a man of no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. Not that he hath no Conſcience, the Diuels themſelues haue a Conſcience, and happy it were for them they had none, but when a man hath not a good one, we eſteeme of him as hauing none at all. There is no greater good we can ſeeke after then a good conſcience. Let vs enquire then how we may get, and keepe this ſo great a good.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience then conſiſting in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> theſe two being gotten and kept, we ſhall get and keepe a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt then to make the Conſcience peaceably good, theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and his blood. The Conſcience cannot be at peace til it be purged from its guilt. An impure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot but be an vnquiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and every guilty Conſcience is impure. Guilt is the ſame to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the winds are to the ſeas, <hi>Iſa. 27. 20. 21. The wicked are like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180769:34"/> Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt vp mire and dirt, There is no peace to the wicked.</hi> Now that which makes the Sea ſo troubleſome and ragingly reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, is the violence of the bluſtering winds that trouble and toſſe it to and fro. The winds are not ſo troubleſome to the ſea, as guilt is to the Conſcience. Therfore as the way to calme the Sea, is to calme the windes; ſo the way to quiet and calme the Conſcience, is to purge and take away the guilt. Guilt is in the Conſcience as <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Ship, out with him and Sea and ſhip are both quiet. But how then ſhall the guilt be purged out of the Conſcience! That we find <hi>Heb. 9. 14. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead works?</hi> We cannot haue a good conſcience till we be freed from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill one. The way to be freed from an euill conſcience, is to haue <hi>our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, Heb.</hi> 10. 22. But what is that wherwith the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt be ſprinckled to be made good with peace &amp; quietnes? The ſame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180769:34"/> which we finde 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. The ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heb. 12. 24. The blood of ſprinkling which ſpeakes better things then that of Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then the Conſcience ſprinckled with Chriſts blood ceaſes to be evill, becomes good and peaceable. The ſame Chriſt that calmed the rage of the Sea by ſtilling the winds, <hi>Mark. 4. 39. He aroſe &amp; rebuked the wind, &amp; ſaid vnto the Sea, Peace &amp; be ſtil, and the wind ceaſed, and there was a great calme.</hi> The ſame Chriſt it is that ſtils the rage of the conſcience, by taking and purging away the guilt therof, with the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on of his blood. His blood <hi>ſpeakes, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. And ſpeakes not onely to God, but ſpeaks to the conſcience. The voyce which it ſpeakes, is <hi>Peace and be ſtill,</hi> the ſame voyce which to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after his reſurrection, <hi>Peace be with you,</hi> &amp; then follows a great calme, and peace makes the conſcience good.</p>
               <p>But here the conſcience will inquire how it may come to get this blood ſprinkled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to make it thus peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:180769:35"/> good, and what is it that applies this calming blood of Chriſt. I anſwer therefore, That it is the grace of faith, therefore it was ſayd before, that faith in Chriſts blood makes peace in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Faith is the hand of the ſoule, and as the hyſſop ſprinckle, by which Chriſts blood is ſprinkled vpon our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. Let vs draw neere with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> And <hi>being iuſtified by faith we haue peace towards God. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Hence that coniunction of faith and a good conſcience, 1. <hi>Tim. 1. 5. of a good conſcience, &amp; of faith vnfained,</hi> &amp; <hi>v. 19. Holding faith and a good conſcience.</hi> For faith it is that makes a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, by making a quiet conſcience. Faith is not only a purifying grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. but it is alſo a pacifying grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1 It not onely purges our corruption, by applying the efficacy of Chriſts blood, but ſpecially purges out guilt by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the merit of his blood. So that no faith, no peace; &amp; no peace, no good
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:180769:35"/> conſcience. A defiled conſcience can be no good conſcience, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the conſcience? See <hi>Tit. 1. 15. Vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, nothing is pure, but even their minde and conſcience is defiled.</hi> They that be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led haue their conſciences defiled, but how come they and their conſciences ſo? <hi>To them that are defiled and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</hi> Therefore an vnbeleeuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a defiled conſcience, &amp; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed conſcience is no good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, becauſe it can haue no peace ſo long as it is clogged with defiling guilt. But contrarily faith purifying not onely from corruption, but from guilt, by the application of Chriſts blood makes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conſcience pure, and peaceable both.</p>
               <p>There can be no <hi>peace</hi> of conſcience but where there is the <hi>righteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſe</hi> of the perſon. There is no peace to the wicked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21. as if he ſhould ſay, an evil vnrighteous perſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue a good conſcience, where the perſon is evill, there the conſcience cannot bee good. Now faith in Chriſts blood
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180769:36"/> makes a mans perſon good, and ſo the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience becomes good. It makes the perſon <hi>righteous,</hi> and the perſon being <hi>righteous,</hi> the conſcience is at <hi>peace,</hi> for <hi>the worke</hi> of righteouſnes is peace, <hi>and the effect</hi> of righteouſnes, quietnes, <hi>and aſſurance for ever, Iſa.</hi> 32. 17. with which that of the Apoſtle ſweetly ſutes, <hi>Reu. 7. 2. Firſt, King of</hi> righteouſnes, <hi>and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that King of</hi> peace. Our perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s muſt firſt find Chriſt a King of <hi>righteouſnes</hi> by iuſtifying them from their guilt. before our conſciences can finde him King of <hi>Salem,</hi> pacifying them from their vnquietnes. Our perſons once <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> by Chriſts blood fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their guilt, and vnrighteouſnes, our conſciences are <hi>pacified</hi> and freed from their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou then haue a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Get the peace of Conſcience. Wouldſt thou haue peace in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Get faith in thy ſoule; Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus, and get thy ſoule ſprinkled with his blood, and then, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. Thou ſhalt haue no more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180769:36"/> conſcience of ſin, thy conſcience ſhall be at quiet, no more accuſing thee, nor threatning thee condemnation for thy ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance</hi> from dead workes. Though Chriſts blood be that which purges the conſcience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead works, and ſo workes peace; yet that peace is not wrought in our apprehenſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we get the feeling of this faith without ſome further thing. Therefore to our faith muſt be ioyned our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though not in the making of our peace, yet for the feeling of it. Many are ready to catch at Chriſts blood, &amp; if that will make a good conſcience, they are then fafe enough. But as thou muſt haue Chriſts blood, ſo Chriſt wil haue thine heart alſo bleed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ere he will vouchſafe the ſenſe of peace. A conſcience therefore that would be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in hauing peace, muſt not onely be a <hi>beleeuing,</hi> but a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi> conſcience. <hi>Mat. 3. 2. Repent ye, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand,</hi> the kingdome of heauen ſhall be yours if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180769:37"/> you will repent, ye ſhall haue it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vpon your repentance. But wherein ſtands this kingdome offered to repentant conſciences? <hi>The kingdom of God ſtands in peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom. 14. 17. Repent, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the gift of the holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 3. 38. And what may that gift be. <hi>The fruits of the ſpirit are loue, ioy, peace, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Which though it be to be vnderſtood of peace between man &amp; man, yet alſo that peace which is between God and man is the fruit of the Spirit, &amp; <hi>the loue of God ſhed abroad into our hearts by the holy Ghoſt. Rom.</hi> 5. 5. is the gift of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which he giues to all that by repentance ſeeke to get a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> that is, which repent, <hi>for they ſhal be comforted, Mat.</hi> 5. they ſhall haue the peace of a good Conſcience, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and ſweeteſt comfort in the world.</p>
               <p>Many doe truſt all to their ſuppoſed faith, as a ſhort cut and a compendious way to a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, but he whoſe faith doth not as well purifie the heart
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180769:37"/> as pacifie it, hath neither faith, nor a good conſcience. It is idle to hope for peace by faith whilſt thou liveſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently in a ſinfull courſe. Thou canſt haue no peace of conſcience ſo long as thou haſt peace with thy ſinnes. Peace with conſcience will be had by warre with ſin, in the daily practiſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is but a dreame to thinke of a good Conſcience in peace, whileſt a man makes no conſcience of ſin. They that haue a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience by Chriſts blood, may be indeed ſayd to haue no Conſcience of ſinne, as <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>b.</hi> 10. 2. But yet there is a great difference between <hi>having</hi> no Conſcience, and <hi>making</hi> no Conſcience of ſinne. To <hi>haue</hi> no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne, is to haue a peaceable good conſcience, not accuſing for ſin, being ſprinkled with Chriſts blood. To <hi>make</hi> no Conſcience of ſin, is for a man impenitently to liue, &amp; lye in any ſin. Now let any iudge whether theſe two can ſtand together, that a man may liue as he liſt, and <hi>make no Conſcience</hi> of any ſinne, and yet haue ſuch peace by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180769:38"/> faith as that he <hi>hath no Conſcience</hi> of ſin. It is an vnconſcionable thing in this ſenſe to lay all vpon Chriſt, an vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable requeſt to haue him take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our guiltines, and yet wee would wallow in our filthines ſtill. How ſhall faith remooue the ſting, when repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance remooues not the ſinne.</p>
               <p>Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeking peace by faith in Chriſts blood, and yet liuing and lying in their ſinnes without repentance, God will giue them <hi>Iehues</hi> anſwere to <hi>Iehoram, 2 King. 9. 22. What peace ſo long as the whoredomes of thy mother lezebel, &amp; her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> So what peace of Conſcience ſo long as thine oaths, Sabbath-breaches, whordomes, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, &amp;c. do remaine, &amp; remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, and vnreformed. It is true of all ſinne, which is ſpoken of Romiſh Idolatry, <hi>Apoc. 14. 11. They haue no reſt day nor night,</hi> that is, no peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to any of that religion, ſo of all that liue in any ſinne, they haue no true reſt day or night, that is, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it, There is no peace to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180769:38"/> Peace and wickednes liue not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder one roofe. Wouldſt thou then haue a peaceable heart? Get an humbled, a mourning, and a repentant heart for ſin. The leſſe peace with ſin, the more peace with God and our own Conſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The conſtant and conſcionable exerciſe of prayer. An excellent means to helpe vs to the ſenſe of that peace which makes the Conſcience good. He that hath a good Conſcience wil make Conſcience of prayer. And prayer will helpe to make a good Conſcience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Philip. 4. 7.

               <p>Gods Miniſters are oft ſlighted, and light ſet by, Preachers cannot be regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, but God hath giuen men a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in their own boſome, &amp; this Prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cher wil make many a curtaine Sermon will take men to taske vpon their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and will bee Preaching ouer our Sermons againe to them. And though many will not be brought to repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sermons in their Families, yet they haue a Repeater in their boſome, that will be at priuate repetitions with them in ſpite of them, &amp; will tel them, This is not according to that you haue bin taught, you haue bin taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you haue bin reproved for, and convinced of this ſinne in the publike Miniſterie, &amp;c.

               <p>But alas, how few regard the voyce of Conſcience, and once hearken to it, and the very want of this dutie is it which breeds ſo much ill conſcience in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180769:49"/> the world. Men in this caſe are guilty of a double wickedneſſe. Either they deale as the Iewes with the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 18. and 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2. 16. They either <hi>ſtop Conſciences mouth,</hi> and labour to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence this Preacher, or elſe they deale with Conſcience as the Iewes did with <hi>Stephen, Acts 7. 57. They ſtopped their eares:</hi> If they cannot ſtop Conſciences mouth, they will at leaſt ſtoppe their owne eares.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They labour to ſtoppe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences mouth. If conſcience beginne to take them aſide, and to ſay to them as <hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Eglon; Iudg. 3. 19.

The clutter of their many buſineſſes make too great a noyſe for Conſcience to haue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180769:51"/> They deal with their conſciences as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> dealt with <hi>Alexander, Act. 19. 33. 34. And Alexander beckned with the hand, and would haue made his defence vnto the people.

Such a noyſe of an outragious bellowing multitude had bin almoſt enough to haue drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the voice of a Canon.

The ſame tricke doe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny put vpon their conſciences, if they wil be clamouring they will haue ſome Drum or other, whoſe greater noyſe may deafe their eares from hearing the cryes of conſcience.</p>
               <p>But alas what poore Proiects are theſe? The time will come when men ſhal haue neither pleaſures nor profits, neither delights nor buſineſſe, to ſtop their eares. Though now men beat vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Drumme-heads, and with the noiſe of their pleaſures &amp; profits, keepe conſcience voyce vnder from beeing heard. Yet the day will come, when God will beat out theſe Drum-heads, and then the cries, &amp; horrid, &amp; hideous
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180769:52"/> ſhrikes of Conſcience ſhall be heard. God will one day ſtrip thee of all thy pleaſures and employments, and will turne thee ſingle and looſe to thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and it ſhall haue full liberty to bait thee, and byte thee at pleaſure.

Theſe are good things, and ſuch things as men ought to make Conſcience of, but yet here is not enough to make a good Conſcience.

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:180769:57"/> ye ſee they will not doe that which is not lawfull.

They make a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of receiuing the price of blood into the treaſury, they make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of receiuing the guilt of blood into their Conſciences. Iuſt ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as they had. <hi>Ioh. 18. 28.

They make conſcience of being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by going into the Iudgement hall, but make no conſcience of being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of an Innocent. Such was the conſcience of the Iewes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 31. they make Conſcience of the body of Chriſt hanging vpon the

This was iuſt like to thoſe that <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeakes of, who made great conſcience of keeping ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly-dayes, yet made no conſcience of vncleaneneſſe, that was but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing with them. As if Conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence were not rather to bee made of keeping our veſſells in holines, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then dayes holy? Remarkeable in this kinde is that dealing of the <hi>Iewes</hi> with <hi>Paul. 2 Cor. 11. 24. Of the Iewes fiue times receiued I fortie ſtripes ſaue one.</hi> If we looke into the Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1. 2. 3. it runs thus, <hi>If there be a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, &amp;c. and it ſhall be if the wicked man be worthy to bee beaten, the Iudge ſhall cauſe him to lie downe, and to bee beaten before his face according to his fault by a certaine number, fortie ſtripes hee may giue him and not exceed.</hi> Now ſee the good conſcience of theſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> they might giue forty ſtripes, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that number might they goe.

It makes conſcience ſpecially of Iudgement, and the weightie matters of the law, but yet doth not therefore thinke it ſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of all care in ſmaller things, doth not therevpon challenge a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from obedience in meaner matters, as if it were needleſſe ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity, and too much preciſeneſſe to tythe Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin. A Cummin-ſeed indeed is but a ſmall thing, a very toy, but yet as ſmall a thing, and as light as it is, yet will it lye heavie vpon a good Conſcience, being iniuriouſly and fraudulently deteyned from the Levites. The <hi>Phariſes</hi> tythed Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin, but they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180769:60"/> neglected the weighty matters of the Law. It is no good Conſcience that lookes to ſmall, and neglects great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, neither is it a good conſcience on the other ſide that looks after the great and weightie duties, and makes no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of Mint and Aniſe. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſayes both ought to be done. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> could be content that the people ſhould goe ſacrifice, but hee cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be ſo peeviſhly preciſe, that not an hoofe ſhall be left behinde. Alas, an hoofe is but a toy, not worth the mentioning, what need <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſo ſtrict as to ſtand vpon an hoofe? Yet a good Conſcience will ſtand vpon it, having Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; will make Conſcience as well of carrying away hoofs as of whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of cattell.

A good Conſcience ſtraines not onely at a camell, but at a gnat alſo. Neither doth our Sauiour blame the <hi>Phariſes</hi> ſimply for ſtrayning at a Gnat, but for their hypocriſie, who would pretend Conſcience in ſmaller things, &amp; meane while made none in the greater; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a good conſcience indeede hath a narrow paſſage for a Gnat, as well as for a Camell. The leaſt corn of grauell galles his foote that hath a ſtreight ſhooe, but he that hath a large wide ſhooe, ſlopping about his foot, it is no trouble to him.

It is no good Conſcience when a man will bee ſubiect for his skins ſake, and leaſt hee ſmart by the Magiſtrates ſword, but then a mans Conſcience is good, when in obedience to Gods Word, and in conſcience of his Commandement he ſubiects. The like may be ſaid of all by-ends. Ye muſt doe good duties, not for profit, not for credit, not for vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, not for law, but for conſcience ſake; or elſe evill conſciences ye haue in that ye doe.

When a man <hi>for Conſcience towards God endures griefe, ſuffering wrong.</hi> A good conſcience had rather that <hi>Ananias</hi> ſhould ſmite, then it ſelfe ſhould. <hi>Ananias</hi> his blowes are nothing to the blowes of Conſcience. <hi>Ananias</hi> may make <hi>Pauls</hi> cheekes glowe, but conſcience giues ſuch terrible buffets, as will make the ſtouteſt heart in the world to ake. That will pinch, and twitch, and gird the heart with ſuch griping throws, that all the blowes, and tortures that <hi>Ananias</hi> his cruell heart can invent are nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Now therefore a man that ſets any ſtore by a good conſcience, will not part with the Peace or Integritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180769:72"/> vpon any termes. He rates the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his Conſcience farre aboue all carthly things. Wealth, libertie, wife, children, life it ſelfe, all are vile, and cheape in compariſon of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man of a good Conſcience, will endure any griefe, &amp; ſuffer any wrong to keepe his conſcience good towards God. Such a good Conſcience had <hi>Daniel.</hi> Dan. 1. 8. <hi>Hee purpoſed in his heart that hee would not defile himſelfe with the portion of the Kings meat.</hi> That is, he was fully ſetled, &amp; reſolued in his Conſcience, come what would come, he would not do that which would not ſtand with a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. But what if he could haue gotten no other meat? Without all doubt hee would rather haue ſtarved, then haue defiled his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with that meat. He would haue loſt his life rather then haue loſt the Peace, and Integritie of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It ſeemes a queſtion of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, which was put to the three Children, <hi>Dan,</hi> 3. Whether they will giue the bowing of their bodies to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180769:73"/> golden Idoll, or the burning of their bodies to the fiery Fornace. But yet they finde no ſuch difficultie therein, they were not carefull to anſwer in that matter. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Of the two fires they chooſe the cooleſt, &amp; the eaſieſt. The fire of a guiltie conſcience is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times hotter, and more intollerable then the fire of <hi>Nebucadnezzars</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, though it be heated ſeauen times more then it is wont to be heated.</p>
               <p>If the queſtion come betweene life and good Conſcience, that one of the two muſt bee parted withall, it is an hard caſe. Life is wondrous ſweet and pretious.

Thus it is with a man that hath a good conſcience, when the caſe comes to this pinch, that either his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts, or his inward Peace muſt wrack, he will chearfully <hi>caſt the wheat into the Sea,</hi> will part with all earthly commodities &amp; comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will ruſh, and wrack his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vpon any rocke.

               <p>There is as great a difference between a good conſcience, and all outward things even vnto life it, ſelfe, as is between the arme, &amp; the head or heart. The brain and the heart are vitall parts, therefore when the head is in danger to bee cleft, or the heart to bee thruſt through, a man will not ſtand queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whether he were beſt adventure his hand, or his arme to ſaue his head, or his heart, but either of theſe being in danger, the hand &amp; the arme preſently interpoſe themſelues to receiue the blow, and put themſelues in danger of being wounded, or cut off, rather then the head or heart ſhould be pierced. A man may haue his hand, or arme cut off, and yet may liue, but a wound in the braine or heart is mortall. It is ſo in this caſe. A good Conſcience values its owne peace aboue all the world, It is that wherein a Chriſtians life lyes, therefore he will ſuffer the right hand or foot to be cut off, and looſe all rather then expoſe Conſcience to danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

A man may goe to heauen though he looſe riches, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, life, but if a good Conſcience be loſt, there is no comming thither. All things compared to Conſcience are as farre beneath it, as the leaſt finger beneath the head. He were a mad man that would ſuffer his skull to bee cleft to ſaue his little finger, nay but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his nayle.

               <p>Try mens Conſciences here, and we ſhall finde them exceeding ſhort. A good Conſcience will endure any griefe, and ſuffer any wrong rather then ſuffer the loſſe of its owne peace. God commands <hi>Amaziah.</hi> 2. Chro. 25 to put away <hi>Iſrael,</hi> oh! but <hi>what ſhall I

So here lyes a diſpute between conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Gaine, which of theſe two muſt be parted with. If now in this caſe a man will growe to this reſolution. By Gods helpe I am reſolued to keepe a good conſcience in keeping Gods Commandement, and Sabbath, I will rather looſe the beſt cuſtomer I haue, &amp; the beſt gueſt I haue, then the peace of a good conſcience.

               <p>Now put mens Conſciences vpon this tryall, and their inconſtancy either in good cauſes, or courſes, wil diſcouer their naugtineſſe.

Now he preſently delivers him to bee crucified, though hee knowes in his Conſcience that

How many a man is there that hath the good word of all men, no man but ſpeakes wel of him, but yet in the meane time, his own heart giues him bitter words, and rates him to his face. How well contented would ſuch an one bee, and what an happy exchange would hee hold it, to haue all the world rayle on him, &amp; ſlander him, ſo his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would but ſpeak friendly &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. So he could find hony from his Conſcience, hee would not care what gall he had from the world.</p>
               <p>Experience lets vs ſee that ſuch as haue bin malevolent and iniurious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others innocency, though they

But now all this while how is it with <hi>Noah,</hi> hee ſits dry in his cabbin, and litterally was the ſaying of the Pſalme verified of him, <hi>Surely in

Iuſt ſuch is the condition, and happineſſe of a man with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in ſad times. Whileſt the high hils and mountaines are covered, the great and braue ſpirits of the world are overwhelmed with feare, are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with dreadfull apprehenſions, ſo as they know not which way to look, nor which way to take, even then a man with a good conſcience hath a ſtrange quiet of heart, is full of ſweet ſecurity and reſolution, &amp; amids all the ſhrikes,

His Ark is pitcht within &amp; without. The peace of God, and the peace of a good Conſcience, keeps the waterfloods from comming into his ſoule.

A man that hath an ill Conſcience, if his eyes be opened, and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a wakened, he ſees death in all the terrible ſhapes that may bee.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:180769:108"/> he ſees death comming like a mercileſſe Officer, and a cruell Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, to arreſt, and to drag him by the throat to the priſon and place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Pſ. 55. 15.

There is no one thought ſo terrible to ſuch an one, as the thought of death, nothing that he more wiſhes to avoyd. Oh! how loath, and how vnwilling is ſuch an one to dye.</p>
               <p>But come now to a man that hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as <hi>Paul</hi> did in all good conſcience, and how is it with him vpon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed?

               <p>The day of a mans marriage <hi>is the day of the ioy</hi> of a mans <hi>heart, Cant.</hi> 3. 11. and the day of marriage is not ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a day, as is the day of death to a good conſcience. There are but fewe that can marry with that ioy wherwith a good conſcience dyes.</p>
               <p>It enables a man, not onely to looke <hi>Ananias</hi> and the Councell in the face, but even to looke death it ſelfe in the face, without thoſe amazing terrours, yea, it makes the face of death ſeeme louely and amiable. He whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is good, and fees the face of God reconciled to him in Chriſt, he can ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> did when he ſaw the face of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Gen. 46. 30. Now let me dye, ſince I haue ſeene thy face.</hi> It is the priviledge of a good Conſcience alone, to goe to the grave, as <hi>Agag</hi> did to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and to ſay that truely, which he ſpake beſides the booke, 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 32. He came pleaſantly,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:180769:109"/> And he ſayd, Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt.</hi> He was deceived, and therefore had no ſuch cauſe to be ſo pleaſant, but a good Conſcience can, yea, cannot chuſe but be ſo pleaſant, even when go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing out of the world, becauſe the gilt of ſin being waſhed away in Chiſts bloud; it knowes that the bitternes of death is paſt, and the ſweetneſſe of life eternall is at hand.</p>
               <p>A man whoſe debts are paid, he dares goe out of dores, dare meete and face the Sergeants, and the conſcience pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the bloud of Chriſt, can looke as vndau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tedly on the face of death. He that hath gotten the ſting, that is, the guilt of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, taken away by faith in Chriſt, he lookes not vpon death as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> vpon the fiery Serpents, but lookes vpon it as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. O death where is thy ſting?</hi> Who feares a Bee, an Hornet, a Snake, or a Serpent, when they haue loſt their ſting. The guilt of ſinne is the ſting of Conſcience, is the ſting of death that ſtings the conſcience. <hi>The ſting of death
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:180769:110"/> is ſinne. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. Plucke then ſinne out of the conſcience, and at once the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is made good, and death made weake, and is diſarmed of his weapon. And when the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſees death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingd and diſarmed, it is freed of feare, and even in the very act of death, can ioyfully tryumyh over death, oh Death where is thy ſting?</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience lookes vpon death, as vpon the Sheriffe that comes to giue him poſſeſſion of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or as <hi>Lazarus</hi> vpon the Angels that came to carry his ſoule into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſome, and therefore can well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and entertain him ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And wheras an ill conſcience makes a man ſee death as if he ſaw the Devill, a good conſcience makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee the face of death, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw <hi>Eſaues</hi> face, <hi>Gen. 33. I haue ſeene thy face, as, the face of God;</hi> they ſee the face of death with vnſpeakable ioy, rauiſhment of heart, and exultation of ſpirit.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:180769:110"/> Even <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelfe would faine make a good end, &amp; dye in peace, and who wiſhes not his deathbed may be a Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> from whence he may ſee that heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> Lo here, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> the way to dye the death of the righteous, <hi>I haue liued in all good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto this day.</hi> They that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in their life, ſhall haue comfort, at their death; They that liue conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, ſhal die comfortably; They that live in all good Conſcience til their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, ſhall depart in the abundance of comfort at their dying day.</p>
               <p>There will come a day wherein we muſt lay downe theſe Tabernacles, the day of death will aſſuredly come. How lamentable a thing will it then be, to be ſo deſtitute, &amp; deſolate of all comfort, as to be driven to that extremity, as to curſe our birth day? oh! what would Comfort be worth at our laſt houre, at our laſt gaſpe, whileſt our deareſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſhall be weeping, wringing their hands and lamenting, then, then what would inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort be worth?

It is otherwiſe an vnſpeak able ioy, that ſuch a Conſcience as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi> was, will ſpeake to a man vpon his death-bed.</p>

Levit. 26. 36. A dreadfull ſound is in his cares, Iob</hi> 15, 21. Hee heares nothing, but he thinkes he heares alwayes ſome terrible and dreadfull noyſe.

               <p>It will be with good and evill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at that day, as it was with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs</hi> Butler, and Baker, on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> birth-day.

               <p>THus haue wee ſeene the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d motiue to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> from the benefite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good Conſcience, in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and times, as a man ſtands moſt in need of comfort. A <hi>ſecond motiue</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and that is that we finde, <hi>Prov. 15. 15. A good Conſcience is a continuall feaſt.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>feaſt. 2. Better</hi> then a feaſt. It is a <hi>continuall</hi> feaſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a feaſt.</hi> The excellency of a good Conſcience is ſet forth by the ſame thing, by which our Saviour ſets forth the happineſſe of heauen. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Quo enim melius epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi quam bonis fact is, aut quid aliud iam facile po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt explere iuſtorum mentes qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boni operis conſcientia. Ambr de offic. l. 1. c. 31</note> And well may both be ſet forth by the ſame metaphor, conſidering what a neere affinity there is betweene heauen
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180769:116"/> and a good Conſcience, &amp; that there is no feaſting in heauen, vnleſſe there be firſt the feaſt of a good Conſcience here on earth. But why a <hi>feaſt?</hi> A feaſt for three regards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>ſelfe ſufficiency,</hi> and ſweet <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>contentment</hi> that a good Conſcience hath within it ſelfe. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting &amp; faſting are oppoſite. In faſting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the want of food there is an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and a griping hunger, which makes the body inſatiably to craue. But at a feaſt there is abundance, and variety of all diſhes and dainties, ready at hand to ſatisfie a mans appetite to the full, he can haue a mind to nothing but it is before him. The very beſt of euery thing that is to bee had is at a feaſt. <hi>A feaſt of fat things, Iſa. 25. 6. of fat things full of marrow.</hi> Such is the ſufficiency of ſatisfaction, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſweetnes, and contentment that is to be found in a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is a table richly furniſht with all varieties, and dainties. There is no pleaſure, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, or contentment that a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180769:117"/> mans heart can wiſh, but it may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly had in a good Conſcience; as at a feaſt there is a collection of all the dainties and delicacies that ſea and land can affoord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>mirth,</hi> and <hi>ioy</hi> of it. <hi>A feaſt is made for laughter, Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 19. At a feaſt there is mirth, muſick, and delight in the comfortable vſe of the creatures. Heauineſſe of heart, penſineneſſe, and ſorrow, theſe are baniſht fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of feaſting. Faſting &amp; feaſting are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, in faſting indeede there is wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, mourning, and ſorrowing, but in a feaſt contrarily, there is mirth, merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ioy.</p>
               <p>There were vnder the Law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo lemne holy feaſts anniverſarily to be celebrated, and at thoſe ſolemne feaſts were the ſilver trumpets ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 10. and the ſound of the trumpets was a <hi>ioyfull ſound. Pſal,</hi> 89. 15. For their feſtivities were to bee kept with ſpeciall ioy. <hi>Deut. 16. 10. 11. 13. 14. 15. Thou ſhalt keepe</hi> the feaſt <hi>of weekes vnto the Lord. &amp;c. and thou ſhalt</hi> reioyce <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:180769:117"/> the Lord, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt obſerue the</hi> feaſt <hi>of Tabernacles ſeuen dayes, &amp;c. And thou ſhalt</hi> reioyce <hi>in thy</hi> feaſt <hi>&amp;c. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt ſurely reioyce.</hi> And that extraordinary feaſt on the fourteenth and fifteenth of <hi>Ader,</hi> in memoriall of their deliuerance from <hi>Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſee how it was kept, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 9. 19. 22. They kept them dayes <hi>of gladneſſe and feaſting, of feaſting and ioy.</hi> Euen ſuch is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a good Conſcience. All the merriment and muſicke, wine &amp; good cheere, will not make a mans heart ſo light and ſo merry, as the wine which is drunke at the feaſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will doe. This takes away all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe and ſadneſſe of ſpirit, and hath the like effects with naturall wine. It makes a man <hi>forget his</hi> ſpirituall <hi>pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and remember that miſery no more, Pro.</hi> 31. 7. Nay, as wine not onely takes away ſadnes, but withall brings a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gladnes with it. <hi>Pſal. 104. 15. Wine that makes glad the heart of man,</hi> ſo doth this wine at this feaſt. <hi>Pſal. 97. 11. 12. Light is ſowne for the righteous, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:180769:118"/> gladnes for the vpright in heart, Reioyce in the Lord ye righteous.</hi> None ſo glad an heart, as the vpright in heart. Nay, ſuch is the vigour and ſtrength of this wine, at this feaſt, that it not only glads a mans heart, but makes a man as not able to containe, euen to ſhout for ioy, <hi>Pſal. 32. 11, Shout for ioy all yee that are vpright in heart,</hi> yea <hi>ſhout alowd for ioy, Pſal.</hi> 132. 16. That looke as it is ſayde of the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 78. 65. The Lord awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked like a mighty man that ſhouts by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of wine.</hi> So ſuch is the plenty, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſweetnes, and ſtrength of the wine of this feaſt, that it makes men in a holy iollity, euen to breake forth into ſhouting, &amp; ſinging. This wine being liberally drunken, wherein there is no exceſſe, fills a mans heart with ſuch an ouerflowing exuberancy of ioy, as hee cannot hold, but he muſt needs ſhew it in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpirituall ſongs; and hence it is, that <hi>the righteous do ſing and reioyce, Pro.</hi> 29. 6. So that what ioy a feaſt can yeeld, that can a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience yeeld much more, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180769:118"/> 
                  <hi>This is our</hi> reioycing <hi>the testimony of our Conſcience.</hi> Yea and that ioy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. At the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles what was it but a type of that ſpirituall ioy, that the faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt ſhould haue in keeping the feaſt of a good conſcience? The feaſt of a good conſcience is the true feaſt of Tabernacles, in which as in the other, there ſhall need no charge to reioyce, and be merry, this feaſt will put ſuch ſpirit and life into a man, as ſhall make him ſing, skip, and ſhout for ioy.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of a good conſcience is not like a funerall feaſt, where mirth and ioy are vnſeemely, and vnſeaſonable gueſts, there are heauy hearts &amp; looks, teares, and mourning (which by the way how well they ſuit with feaſting, let the world iudge) but the feaſt of a good conſcience is a nuptiall feaſt, a marriage feaſt, and the day of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is <hi>the day of the ioy of a mans heart, Cant.</hi> 3. 11. Such a feaſt, euen a ioyfull marriage feaſt doth a good conſcience make.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:180769:119"/>
               <p>Oftentimes theſe bodily feaſts are but heauy feaſts, many for all their good cheere, company, and muſicke, cannot put away the heavines of their hearts, but euen in their feaſt are ſad hearted, and <hi>Sampſons</hi> wife <hi>wept</hi> all the dayes of the feaſt, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 17. yea though a marriage feaſt. But in this feaſt of a good conſcience here is no ſorrow, heauines, or ſad melancholly, but all ioy and gladnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>ſocietie</hi> &amp; <hi>company.</hi> A feaſt is a collection, and a convention of many good friends together, whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and fellowſhip is ſweet each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is no feaſt can affoord the like company that a good conſcience hath. <hi>Woe to him that is alone. Eccl.</hi> 4. that is the woefull and ſolitary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euill conſciences. But a good conſcience hath euer good company, <hi>is not alone,</hi> for the Father is with him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 32. yea, the Sonne is with it, and Chriſt, and the man with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they <hi>ſuppe,</hi> and <hi>feaſt</hi> together. <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 20. Yea, and the Spirit is with it.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:180769:119"/> 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 13. The Communion of the holy Ghoſt be with you.</hi> What feaſt in the world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany? And good company is the chiefe thing in a feaſt. Thus a good conſcience is a feaſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>better</hi> then a feaſt. And that in three regards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>continuance,</hi> and <hi>perpetuity</hi> of it. <hi>A continuall feaſt. Nabal</hi> made a feaſt, a feaſt like a King. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. but that feaſt laſted but one day. <hi>Sampſon</hi> at his marriage had a feaſt that laſted ſeuen daies. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 17. but yet that feaſt had an end, <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> his feaſt was the longeſt feaſt that euer we reade of. <hi>Eſth. 1. 4. He made a feaſt many dayes, an hundred and foureſcore dayes.</hi> But yet, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. it is ſayd, <hi>And when thoſe daies were expired.</hi> So this long feaſt had an end. It was continued for many daies, but yet no continuall feaſt, it had an end. The feaſt of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not like an <hi>Vniuerſity</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement feaſt. Great exceedings, &amp; extraordinary good cheere and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for one night, but the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:180769:120"/> to their bare Commons againe. Not like the <hi>feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Natiuity,</hi> at which time there is great feaſting, and great cheere every where for twelue dayes, but when thoſe dayes are ouer, many a man is glad of bread &amp; cheeſe, glad to skip at a cruſt. But this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feaſt all the year long, all a mans life long. Therefore 1. <hi>Theſ. 5. 16. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce euermore,</hi> keepe open houſe, and feaſting all the yeare long. The ioy of a good conſcience was figured by the ioy at the feaſt of Tabernacles. That feaſt laſted ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daies. The ioy muſt be as long. Seuen the number of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, denoted the whole courſe of a mans life, and ſo their ſeuen daies ioy, the <hi>continuall ioy</hi> and iollity of this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feaſt</hi> of a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>Conſcience, and a wife as they agree in many things, be they good, be they ill, ſo in this alſo. If the conſcience be euill, it is like an <hi>euill wife,</hi> and ſhe is a <hi>continuall euill.</hi> Pro. 27. 15. <hi>A continuall dropping in a very rainy day, &amp; a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious woman are alike.</hi> The contentions
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:180769:120"/> of a wife are <hi>a continuall dropping.</hi> Pro. 19. 13. A ſhrewiſh waſpiſh wife, is a continuall vexation, and diſquiet. Such is an evill Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a continuall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Contrarily, a good Conſcience is like a <hi>good wife.</hi> A good wife is <hi>a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall comfort,</hi> a comfort in health, in ſickneſſe, in peace, in diſtreſſe. <hi>Prov. 31. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not good at ſometime, and none at other times, <hi>but all the dayes of her life,</hi> ſhe is a continuall comfort. Such is the comfort of a good conſcience. It keepes holy day, &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting every day; It is all feaſt; a feaſt for ever; there is no <hi>Lent,</hi> nor <hi>faſting</hi> daies that interrupt this feaſt. This is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priviledge of this feaſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual; belly feaſting cannot be ſo: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man cannot alwaies feaſt though he would, a mans revenewes would be exhauſt, his expenſes would ſoone ſinke his eſtate. Continuall feaſting would ſoone begger &amp; vndoe a man of good

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:180769:124"/> ſo is out of the reach of the poorer ſort. But here is the excellency of this feaſt. The pooreſt that is may make it, and the poore haue as good priviledge to make it as the rich, &amp; the poore in this reſpect may keepe as good an houſe as the beſt Nobleman, yea, for the moſt part the poorer ſort keep this feaſt beſt. <hi>Nabal</hi> makes <hi>a feaſt like a King,</hi> but wretched man, in the meane time what feaſt keepes his Conſcience? It may be many a poore Carmelite neighbour of his, that went in a poore ruſſet coate, and liued in a poore thatcht cottage, kept that feaſt abundantly, and richly, whileſt he poore ſot had not the crums that fell from their Tables. <hi>Lazarus</hi> could not haue the crummes that fell from the gluttons table, but how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie had it beene with the glutton, if in ſtead of his delicious fare hee might haue had but the reverſions of <hi>Lazarus</hi> boord. <hi>Lazarus</hi> may not come to his feaſt, no nor yet to his fragments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will <hi>Lazarus</hi> condition permit him to feaſt it as the glutton did, but yet

What an excellent feaſt is this, aboue all other feaſts, wherein the ruſſet hath as much priviledge as the velvet, the begger as the King, the poore tenant, as the rich Landlord? The rich Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord often ſo feedes vpon, and eates vp his poore tenant by oppreſſion, that the tenant is kept low enough for feaſting; It is well with him if he haue food, he had not need thinke of feaſting.

Can a man be melancholly at a feaſt, at ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo ſweet a feaſt? Doth feaſting make men melancholly, or make men merry? Make men weepe, or laugh? If a man ſhould cry downe feaſting with this argument, That it makes men me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, would not all men laugh him to ſcorne?

Yea, the worſt diſhes of this feaſt, even thoſe at the lower end of the Table, are better then the moſt choyce rarities of other feaſts. The very teares that a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſheds haue more
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:180769:127"/> ioy and pleaſure in them, then the worlds greateſt ioyes. And if the teares of a good conſcience be ſuch, what is the mirth, &amp; laughter of it? If weeping be ſo ſweet, what is ſinging? If the courſer diſhes be ſo daintie, what are the beſt ſervices? Would we then liue merrily, and paſſe our dayes Iocundly indeed? Get a good Conſcience, and thou keepeſt a continuall feaſt, &amp; that continuall feaſt will keepe thee in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall mirth, and continuall ioy. Yea though thou be in affliction, and vnder croſſes, ſo as thy dayes vnto the world may ſeeme exceedingly evill, yet ſhalt thou liue merrily as at a feaſt. Yea, this is the ſcope of that Scripture, <hi>All the dayes of the afflicted are evill,</hi> namely, in the eye and iudgement of the world: <hi>but a good Conſcience,</hi> namely, to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>is a continuall feaſt.</hi> A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience feaſts then, and turnes faſting dayes into feaſting, dayes. A good conſcience feaſts a man in his poverty, in his ſickneſſe, in the priſon, and cheeres vp a man with many a dainty

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:180769:131"/> commodity, a precious fraight, and a good Conſcience is the bottome, and the veſſel wherein it is carried. So long as the Ship is ſafe and good, ſo long the goods therein are ſafe, but if the Ship ſplit vpon the Rockes, or haue but a leake therein, then are all the goods therein in danger of being loſt and caſt away.

So that in this ſenſe, it may be ſaid of an evill Conſcience, which of the Lord is ſayd in another. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 12. Vnto it <hi>the darknes, and the light are both alike.</hi> As full of feare in the light, as in the darke. And beſides, the Lord came but in a gentle wind, the coole breath of the day, now what a ſmall matter is a coole winde, and that in the day time to, to put a man in a feare? Such ſmall things breede great feares in euill conſciences. In what a woefull plight would <hi>Adam</hi> thinke wee haue bin, if the Lord had come to him, at the dead, and darke mid-night with earth-quakes, thunder, and bluſtring tempeſt?</p>
               <p>We may ſee the like in <hi>Gain.</hi> After hee had defiled his Conſcience with his brothers blood, in what feares, yea, what idle feares liued he? Hee is ſo haunted with feares, that though hee had liued in Paradiſe, yet had he liued in a land of <hi>Nod,</hi> in a land of <hi>agitation,</hi> yea, of trepidation. Iudge what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:180769:139"/> caſe his euill Conſcience made him in by that ſpeech. <hi>Gen. 4. 14. It ſhall come to paſſe, that euery one that findes me ſhall ſlay me.</hi> Surely, there could not bee many yet in the world, and thoſe that were in the world, were either his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, brethren, ſiſters, or neere kinred. His feare ſeems to imagine multitudes of people that might meet him, yea, &amp; that euery one he meetes would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him. What will his Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee his executioners? What if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſiſters meete him, ſhall they ſlay him, is not ſuch a ſwaſh-buckler as he, able to make good his party with them? Loe what fearfull, &amp; terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things a guilty conſcience proiects.</p>
               <p>As an euill Conſcience is miſerable in its <hi>feares,</hi> ſo in thoſe <hi>perplexities</hi> which this feare breedes.

               <p>But the <hi>Torment</hi> exceedes all, and the main miſery of an euill conſcience lies in that.

               <p>The ſting of Conſcience is worſe then death it ſelfe. <hi>Apoc. 9. 5. 6. Their torment was as the torment of a ſcorpion when he ſtrikes a man; And in thoſe dayes ſhall men ſeeke death, and ſhall not finde
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:180769:140"/> it, and ſhall deſire to dye, &amp; death ſhall flee from them,</hi> Popiſh ones tormented in their conſciences, by the terrible and vncomfortable doctrines of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Purgatory fire, &amp;c. which thoſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> ſhould ſo terrifie them withall, ſhould rather chooſe death then liue in ſuch vncomfortable condition: <hi>The ſting of death</hi> not ſo ſmart, as the <hi>ſting of a Scorpion</hi> in the conſcience. The ſting of an accuſing Conſcience, is like an Harlot, <hi>Prov. 7. 26. More bitter then death.</hi> And as <hi>Salomon</hi> there ſpeakes of the Harlot, ſo may it be ſayd of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Conſcience, Who ſo pleaſes God ſhall eſcape from it, but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall be taken by it.</p>
               <p>Gods deare children themſelues, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are not freed from trouble in their Conſciences, but they haue their hells in this life, <hi>Ion. 2. 2. Out of the belly of hell I cryed vnto thee.</hi> God for their tryal ſpeaks bitter things to them, and not onely denyes them peace but, cauſes their conſciences to be at warre with them. Now when God puts his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:180769:141"/> owne children to theſe trials, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets of Conſcience, they are ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ſo biting, that had they not the grace of God to vphold and preſerue them, even they could not bee ſaved from dangerous miſcariages. <hi>Iob</hi> was put to this triall, and his Conſcience apprehended Gods anger, and we ſhall ſee what a caſe he was in. <hi>Iob 6. 8. 9. O that I might haue my requeſt, and that God would grant me the thing I long for, even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would let looſe his hand, and cut me off.</hi> Nay, worſe. <hi>Iob 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 15. Thou ſcareſt me with dreames, and terrifieſt me through viſions, ſo that my ſoule chooſes ſtrangling, and death rather then life.</hi> Gods grace preſerues his Saints from ſelfe-murder, but yet not alwaies from impatient wiſhes; <hi>Iob</hi> wiſhes <hi>ſtrangling,</hi> and chooſes it of the two, but goes no further. What wonder then that <hi>Iudas</hi> doth ſtrangle himſelfe, when his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtares him in the face, when as <hi>Iob,</hi> with whom God is but in ieſt in compariſon, <hi>chooſes ſtrangling.</hi> If <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:180769:141"/> wiſh it, what wonder that <hi>Iudas</hi> doth the deed. Conſcience doth chaſtiſe the godly but with whips, but it laſhes the wicked with ſcorpions. Now if the whips be ſo ſmarting to <hi>Iob,</hi> as makes him <hi>chooſe ſtrangling,</hi> what wonder that the ſcorpions be ſo cutting, as makes <hi>Iudas</hi> ſeeke reliefe at an halter.</p>
               <p>Yea, and that which addes to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of an evill Conſcience, being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, it is ſuch a miſery as no earthly comfort can aſſwage, or mitigate. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and diſtempers of the body, though they be terrible, yet Phyſicke, ſleepe, &amp; reſt upon a mans bed, yeeldes him ſome eaſe, &amp; ſome comfort.

Hee had marred the muſicke of his conſcience, and now he brookes not other muſicke. <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of muſike were not brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> His guilty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience was now awakened, and now he cannot ſleepe; <hi>His ſleepe went from him.</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> in his conflict of Conſcience hoped for eaſe in his bed, <hi>Iob 7. 13. My bed ſhall comfort me, my couch ſhall eaſe my complaint.</hi> But how was it with him? Either he could not ſleepe at all, <hi>verſ. 3. 4.

               </p>
               <p>At other times when conſcience hath been good, Gods people though their dangers haue beene great, yet neither the greatnes, nor neerenes of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue broken their ſleep. <hi>Pſa. 3. 5. 6. I layd me downe and ſlept, I will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ten thouſands of people that haue ſet themſelues againſt me round about.</hi> And yet if we looke to the title of the <hi>Pſalme, A pſalme of Dauid when hee fled from Abſolom his ſonne;</hi> one would thinke <hi>David</hi> ſhould haue had little liſt, or leaſure to haue ſlept. <hi>Peter</hi> thought to haue bin executed the next morrow by <hi>Herod,</hi> and though he alſo lodge betweene a company of ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly Souldiers, that happily one would feare might haue done him ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in his ſleepe, yet how ſoundly

Theſe fears brake not theſe mens ſleepe. How might this come to paſſe? They did as <hi>Pſal. 4. 8. I will lay me down in peace, and ſleepe.</hi> He that can lie down in the <hi>peace</hi> of Conſcience, may <hi>ſleepe</hi> ſoundly, whatſoever cauſes of feare there be otherwiſe. But contrarily, he that cannot lie downe with, the peace of conſcience, will find but little reſt &amp; ſleepe, though his heart bee free from all other feares. Euill conſcience being awakened will fill the heart with ſuch feares, as a man ſhall haue little liberty to ſleepe. Oh the ſweet ſleepe that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> had, and the ſweet dream when he lay vpon the cold earth, and had an hard ſtone vnder his head for his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. An hard lodging, and an hard pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but yet ſweet reſt, and ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. A good conſcience makes any lodging ſoft and eaſie, but down-beds, and down-pillowes, if there bee thornes in the Confcience,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:180769:143"/> are but beds of thornes, and beddes of nettles. The bitterneſſe of an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diſtaſtes all the ſweets of this life, as when the mouth and tongue is furred in an hot Ague, all meates and drinkes are bitter to the ſicke partie.

Death it ſelfe can not awaken ſome conſciences, but no ſooner come they into hell; but Conſcience is there awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to the full, never to ſleepe more; and then ſhe laſhes and gaſhes to the quicke, &amp; lets men learne that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance was no payment. Tell many men of Conſcience, and they are ready to flap one on the mouth with that prophane proverbe, <hi>Tuſh, Conſcience was hanged many yeeres agoe.</hi> But the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:180769:144"/> time will come, that they who haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in euill Conſcience, ſhall finde that Conſcience which they haue counted hanged, ſhall play the cruell hang-man and tormentor with them. They ſhall finde Conſcience vnhanged when it ſhall hang them vp in hell, when day and night it ſhall ſtretch them there vpon the racke.</p>
               <p>The torments which an evill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience puts the damned to in hell, are beyond the expreſſion of the tongue, and the comprehenſion of mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. There bee two ſpeciall things in the torments of hell, wee haue them both thrice repeated together. <hi>Mark. 9. 44. 46. 48. Where their</hi> worme <hi>dies not, and the</hi> fire <hi>is not quenched.</hi> There is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living <hi>worme,</hi> and never-dying <hi>fire.</hi> And marke that in all the three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>worme</hi> is ſet in the firſt place, as it were to teach vs, that the prime and principall torment in hell is the <hi>worme,</hi> rather then the <hi>fire.</hi> And what is the <hi>worme,</hi> but the guilt of an evill Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhall lie eternally gnawing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:180769:144"/> and grapping, twiching, and gryping, the heart of the damned in hell. Men talke much of hell fire, and it were well they would talke more of it; but yet there is another torment forgotten, that would be thought on too. There is an <hi>Hell worme,</hi> as well as there is an <hi>hell-fire.</hi> And it may be a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two is the greateſt torment. And yet no great queſtion neither. For as the Heaven of Heaven, is the peace and ioy of a good, ſo the very Hell of Hell, is the guilt and worme of an evill Conſcience. A man may ſafely ſay, it is better being in Hel with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if that might be, with an evill one. Heaven without a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, what is it better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hel? Paradiſe was an Heauen on earth, but when <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt the Paradiſe of a good conſcience, what ioy did Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe and the pleaſures of the Garden affoord him more, then if he had beene in ſome ſad &amp; ſolitary Deſert? A good conſcience makes a Deſert a Paradiſe, an euill one turnes a Paradiſe into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:180769:145"/> A good Conſcience makes Hell to be no Hell, and an evill one makes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be no Heaven. Both the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; miſery of Heaven and Hell, are from the inward frame of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Hell of Hell, is the worme of Hell, and that worme is the worme of an evill Conſcience, which if it bee not wormed out, and ſo the conſcience in this life made good, it will bee an immortall worme in hell.</p>
               <p>The helliſh diſpaire wherewith the damned are ouerwhelmed, comes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>werme,</hi> then from the <hi>fire.</hi> Whoſe <hi>worme</hi> dies not, and whoſe <hi>fire</hi> is not quenched. The <hi>fire</hi> of Hell never quenches, becauſe the worme of Hell never dies. If the <hi>worme</hi> of Hell would die, the <hi>fire</hi> of Hell would go out. For if there were no guilt there ſhould bee no puniſhment. So that the very Hell of Hell, is that ſelfe-torment which an evill conſcience breeds.</p>

               <p>But eſpecially as thou feareſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerliuing, and evergrabbing worme, ſo haue a care to get a good Conſcience. Greene and rawe fruits breed Cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, which if heede bee not taken will eat the very maw thorow. A dead body and a putrified corrupt carkaſſe, breedes wormes that lye gnawing at it in the graue. The forbidden and rawe fruits of ſinne, are thoſe which breede cheſt-wormes in the Conſcience. The corruptions of the ſoule, and dead works, are thoſe that breed this liuing worme, take hede therefore of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with theſe fruits that will breede
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:180769:146"/> this worme, &amp; get thy conſcience pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from dead works, get this worme killed with the ſooneſt, for if thou let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it liue till thou die, it will neuer die at all, and will put thee to thoſe exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit torments, from which to bee freed thou woldeſt willingly ſuffer ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the moſt cruell deaths that the wit of man were able to inuent.</p>
               <p>As then I ſay thou feareſt this <hi>worme</hi> of Hell, ſo get a good Conſcience. Drinke down euery morning a hearty draught of Chriſts bloud, which may make this worme burſt. And when once this worme is burſt and voyded, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience well purged by Chriſts bloud, take heed ever after of eating thoſe raw fruites that will breed new wormes. Lead ſo holy, ſo vpright, and ſo conſcionable a life, that thou mayſt not by thy freſh ſins clog thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with freſh guilt. Get thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence purged by Chriſts bloud, &amp; thy converſation framed by Gods Word. <hi>Thy words were found by mee, and I did eat them.</hi> Ier. 15. 16. Doe thou ſo,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:180769:146"/> eat no more the vnwholſome &amp; worm breeding fruites of ſinne; but <hi>drinke</hi> Chriſts bloud, and <hi>eate</hi> Gods word, and they both ſhall purifie and ſcoure thy Conſcience from all ſuch ſtuffe, as may breed and feede the Hell-worme of an evill Conſcience.</p>

He hath made a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good Conſcience, and for his good Conſcience ſake are <hi>Ananias</hi> fiſts about his eares. There is nothing ſo mads men of wicked Conſciences, as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:180769:148"/> the profeſſion and practice of a good conſcience doth.

               <p>

So odious a thing is good Conſcience and the profeſſion of it to wicked men. Therefore this is that which a good Conſcience muſt expect, euen <hi>Ananias</hi> his dole, fiſtes,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:180769:148"/> blowes, ſmiting, hard and iuiurious meaſure, from the world.</p>
               <p>This is no new thing. It was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours caſc before it was <hi>Pauls, Ioh. 18. 22. And when he had thus ſpoken, one of the officers which ſtoodby ſtroke Ieſus with the palme of his hand, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22, 63. 64. <hi>And the men that held Ieſus, mocked him, and ſmote him, And when they had blinfolded him, they ſtroke him on the face.</hi> Hee felt the weight of their fiſts for the ſame quarrell that <hi>Paul</hi> did.

                  <hi>Paſhur</hi> is, hee hath fiſts for <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies</hi> face, and ſtockes for his heeles; but in the meane time <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> they may whore, and play the villaines, and they feele not the waight of his little finger. If his fingers muſt needs be walking, there is worke for them, there he may ſtrike, and ſtocke with credit. But there is no ſuch zeale againſt them. No ſuch dealing with them. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> may bee in good tearmes of grace with <hi>Paſhur,</hi> whilſt <hi>Ieremiah</hi> muſt haue on the face. &amp; lie by the heeles. So well can wicked men brooke villany, and any wretched courſes better then they can a good conſcience: <hi>Paſhur</hi> can better endure an adulterous whore maſter, then an honeſt conſcionable Prophet.

That was much that a worm ſhould ſo ſoon ſmite the gourd. But when men will bee ſmiting Gods people, and his Prophets for a good Conſcience, and when <hi>Herod</hi> will be ſo buſie as to ſmite Apoſtles, God can ſend not onely an Angell, one of his moſt glorious creatures, but even a baſe worme, even one of the weakeſt creatures to ſmite <hi>Herod,</hi> and eate him both. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſtretches forth his arme againſt the Prophet, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13. and his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:180769:163"/> arme withers, he doth but threaten to ſmite, and God ſmites him.

               <p>Thus is that true which the Prophet implyes in that ſpeech, <hi>Eſa. 27. 6. Hath hee ſmitten him as hee ſmote his ſmiter?</hi> Marke then Gods dealing, he vſes to ſmite ſmiters.</p>
               <p>Neither is this true onely of ſmiters with the fiſt, and with the ſword, but it is alſo true of thoſe <hi>ſmiters, Ierem. 18. 18.

               <p>Such is that Iuſtice of God threatned. <hi>Heb. 2. 15, 16.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:180769:170"/> no more, becauſe of the ſword which I will ſend amongſt you.</hi> Of this kinde was that Iuſtice of God vpon <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He killes <hi>Vriah</hi> with the <hi>ſword,</hi> therefore the <hi>ſword</hi> ſhall not depart from his houſe; He defiles the wife of <hi>Vriah,,</hi> therefore his Concubines are defiled by <hi>Abſalom.</hi> This is that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, <hi>Apoc. 13. 10. He that leadeth into Captiuity, ſhall goe into Captiuity; he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword.</hi> It was the moſt righteous hand of God vpon <hi>Saul,</hi> that hee that puts Gods Prieſts to the ſword ſhould fall vpon his owne ſword; &amp; iuſt with God that <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, that would haue kept the Deputy in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, ſhould himſelfe be ſmitten with bodily blindnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods puniſhments are oft in the <hi>ſame part,</hi> and member of the bodie, wherewith men haue offended. That look as renowned <hi>Cranmer</hi> dealt with himſelfe at his Martyrdome; That hand wherewith hee had ſubſcribed to the ſixe Articles, that hand hee
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:180769:170"/> firſt put in the fire, in an holy reuenge vpon himſelfe; euen ſo deals the Lord very often in his Iuſtice; That which men haue made the inſtrument of their ſinne, God makes the ſubiect of his Iudgements. <hi>Abſaloms</hi> pride, and his weakeneſſe lay where <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength was. <hi>Abſaloms</hi> haire was <hi>Abſaloms</hi> pride, therefore <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaloms</hi> hayre, as it is conceiued, was <hi>Abſaloms</hi> halter, and whileſt hee will needes ſpare the Barber a labour, he alſo ſpares the Hangman a labour, Such was Gods Iuſtice vpon <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelfe. He can finde none to bee the <hi>pleaſure of his eyes,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks of his wife, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. but <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> Iudg. 14. 1, 2, 3. and Chapt. 16. 1. and ſo in the loue of a <hi>Philiſtim, Dalilah,</hi> he abuſes his eyes. What is the iſſue? At laſt the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> put out his eyes. God puniſht the abuſe of his eyes with the loſſe of his eyes, and thoſe eyes that loued <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> were pluckt out by <hi>Philistims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Memorable in this kinde was Gods
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:180769:171"/> iuſtice vpon that French King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, who in a rage againſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Counſellor, committed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of one of his Nobles to bee impriſoned, and that with theſe words, That <hi>hee would ſee him burned with his owne eyes.</hi> But marke the iuſtice of God within a few dayes after, the ſame Noble man with a Launce put into his hands by the King, did at a Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting run the ſaide King into one of his eyes, whereof he dyed.</p>
               <p>Of this kind was the Iuſtice of God, vpon <hi>Zachary, Luke</hi> 1. Offending with his tongue in that queſtion, <hi>How can this be,</hi> he is puniſhed with the loſſe of the vſe of his tongue, and ſpeech for a time. The rich gluttons tongue had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <hi>Lazarus</hi> a crum, therfore it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed a drop of water. The ſame glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had abuſed his <hi>tongue</hi> in gluttony, and therefore his <hi>tongue</hi> hath a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar torment in hell. So thoſe <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 12. had their <hi>tongues conſumed in their mouths,</hi> like enough as with their hands ſo with their tongues they had fought

                  <hi>my Lord</hi> Henry <hi>the Emperour. But the command of the Pope hath brought me to this, that laying a ſide the reſpect of mine Oath, I ſhould vſurpe an honour not due to me.

               <p n="4">4. The equitie of Gods Iuſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in that. <hi>Prou. 26. 27. Who ſo dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a pit ſhall fall therein, and hee that rolles a ſtone, it will returne vpon him.</hi> Such was Gods Iuſtice vpon <hi>Haman,</hi> he made a gallowes for his owne necke.

The Lord <hi>Deu.</hi> 28. 27. threatens the <hi>botch of Egypt,</hi> and how frequently is the ſinne of vncleanneſſe ſmitten with the <hi>French botch,</hi> the fruit of the ſinne? How frequent are the examples of Gods Iuſtice vpon drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, drunkenneſſe their ſinne, and drunkennes their death. And ſo that Proverbe is often verified. <hi>Prou. 5. 22. His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, and he ſhall bee bolden with the cordes of his ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The equitie of Gods Iuſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, when he makes <hi>the place</hi> of ſinne, <hi>the place</hi> of puniſhment. Wee haue frequent examples of this in Scripture. This was threatned <hi>Ahab. 1 King. 21. 19. In the place</hi> where dogges licked the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> ſhall dogs licke thy bloud. And this was made good. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 26. In <hi>Tophet the place</hi> where they had ſlaine their Sonnes, and Daughters, would God ſlay the <hi>Iewes Ier.</hi> 7. 31. 32. And as their <hi>houſes</hi> were the places of their <hi>ſinns,</hi> ſo ſhould their <hi>houſes</hi> bee the <hi>places</hi> of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:180769:173"/> 
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 19. 13. And becauſe the Sabbath was profaned <hi>in the gates</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> therefore <hi>in the gates</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would God kindle a fire. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 27. And remarkeable is that, <hi>Ezek. 6. 13. Their ſlaine men ſhall bee amongſt their Idols round about their altars, and vnder euery thicke Oake,</hi> the place <hi>where they did offer ſweet ſauour to all their Idolls.</hi> Such was the Iuſtice of God in that late blowe vpon that Popiſh Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In the very place where they vſed to diſhonour God, the hand of God was vpon them, they were ſlaine, and their carkaſes cruſhed in the place of their Maſſe-worſhip, the firſt floore falling into their Maſſing place, and ſo they and their Crucifixes, &amp; Images, all daſhed together, God doing with them as with the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Numb. 33. 4. Not onely ſmiting them, but alſo <hi>executing iudgements vpon their gods;</hi> yea, not onely ſo, but executed them and their gods, in the <hi>ſelfe-ſame place,</hi> where God had been by them ſo much diſhonoured.</p>

                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:180769:173"/>6. The equity of Gods iuſtice is to be ſeene in <hi>the time</hi> of his puniſhments. God oft makes <hi>that time</hi> wherein men haue ſinned <hi>the time</hi> of his iudgements. At the time of the Paſſe-over did the Iewes crucifie Chriſt, and at the time of the Paſſe-over was Ieruſalem taken. Heauy is the calamity that is befallen the Churches beyond the Seas, the time wherein the firſt blow was given, is not to be forgotten. The firſt blow was vpon the Sabbath, vpon that day was <hi>Prague</hi> loſt. What one thing haue all thoſe Churches fayled in more, then in that point of the religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that day? That day they neglected to ſanctifie by obedience, vpon that day God would be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his iuſtice vpon them, and <hi>in the time</hi> would haue them reade one cauſe of their puniſhment. Neither is the time wherein God did that late iuſtice vpon thoſe Popiſh perſons to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. It is ſomewhat that after their Roman accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it was vpon their <hi>fift of Nouember,</hi> God would let thoſe of that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:180769:174"/> Ieſuited brood ſee how good it was to blow vp Parliament houſes, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would haue them learne more loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and religion, then to ſcoffe at our new holyday.</p>
               <p>Of this kind was Gods iuſtice vpon one <hi>Leaver,</hi> who rayling on that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Martyr and ſeruant of Chriſt, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Latimer,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that hee ſaw that evill fauoured knaue</hi> Latimer, <hi>when hee was burned,</hi> &amp; <hi>that he had teeth like an horſe,</hi> his ſonne the ſame houre, and at the ſame time as neere as could bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wickedly hanged himſelfe. And the ſame was Gods Iuſtice, ceazing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Steven Gardiner,</hi> the ſame day that <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> were burned.</p>
               <p>Since then there is ſuch an equitie in Gods adminiſtration of iuſtice, let it be our care and wiſdome to obſerue the ſame. Learne to Coment vpon Gods works of Iuſtice, and to compare mens wayes, &amp; Gods workes together. God is to haue the praiſe and glory of his Iuſtice vpon others, as well as of his mercy to ourſelues. Now we ſhal then
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:180769:174"/> be beſt able to giue God this glory, when we ſo obſerue his adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we may bee able not onely to ſay, The Lord is iuſt, but the Lord is iuſt in this, and that particular, when we can ſay, as <hi>Reuel.</hi> 16. 5. not onely <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord that iudgeſt,</hi> but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou O Lord that <hi>iudgeſt thus.
